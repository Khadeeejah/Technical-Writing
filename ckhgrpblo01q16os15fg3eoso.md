## BEST CSS FRAMEWORK FOR BEGINNERS

# INTRODUCTION
CSS frameworks provide different modules and tools for responsive web designs. Actually, I've always been a bootstrap girl from day one but I stumbled on other CSS frameworks that have become a personal favourite.

Bellow are the best CSS frameworks for an upcoming/junior developer. (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER)






# 1 [BOOTSRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/)

 Bootstrap has its own open-source SVG icon library, components and themes. you can install bootstrap for  Sass and JavaScript files via npm

```
npm install bootstrap

```

However, you can should also not forget to link your bootstrap in your HTML when working with bootstrap components for CSS in the head tag of your HTML. not doing this would not reflect in your interface thereby giving you a lot of headaches..lol
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-TX8t27EcRE3e/ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2" crossorigin="anonymous">

``` 

##  [BULMA](https://bulma.io/)

Unlike Bootstrap, Bulma is a pure CSS framework, it doesn't require javascript and its also free.
to run
```
npm install Bulma
``` 
it has the simplest grid system and you can also customise your CSS with Bulma. another framework is tailwind CSS


### [TALWINDCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Unlike other frameworks Instead of opinionated predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

tailwind uses an intuitive {screen}: a prefix that makes it easy to notice responsive classes in your markup while keeping the original class name recognizable and intact. it is component friendly and easy to customise.

the last CSS framework is sematic UI

####  [SEMATIC UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)

Sematic helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using HTML. Semantic uses simple phrases called behaviours that trigger functionality.

it also adds animation to your work. as for me, it's quite complex but very versatile compared to most framework.

it's advisable to master at least 1 framework that works for you.
