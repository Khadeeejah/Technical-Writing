## HOW TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AS AN IT PROFESSIONAL

We all know health is wealth and we can only enjoy our wealth when we are healthyðŸ˜‰. As a Health worker in the developing world, I have come to realise that a lot of my normal healthy routine/pattern has been disorganised, due to the fact that I have to meet up with a deadline or debug or stay up to get inspirations.

This article is not intended to make you feel guilty about your lifestyle, but to make you see some of the dangers you might be causing to yourself unknowingly.

IT Professionals face a lot of physical and mental health challenges in todayâ€™s world. Whether itâ€™s wrist and back pain, migraines, eye strain, loss of motivation, or trouble focusing.

Here are a few tips to take care of yourself and keep your mind and body in excellent shape.


# TAKE A WALK

Weâ€™ve probably all sat in front of our workstations for hours at a time. It causes your back problems, straining your eyes, and sapping your energy, and itâ€™s probably why you have a migraine.

 A recent study has shown that adults who walked for 40 minutes three times a week for a year literally grew their hippocampus! The hippocampus is the part of your brain that helps create new memories. It also helps regulate the autonomic nervous system, as well as your mood. In addition to the cognitive benefits, walking for 20 minutes will cause you to burn an average of 70â€“140 calories. On top of that, walkingâ€™s a great way to prevent back pain

40minutes might seem like a lot, but you can always break it down like this
after 1 hour, get up and walk around the office, or the house if you work remotely for five minutesâ€”stop by the kitchen, speak with a coworker, or use the restroom even. when you sit back down, youâ€™ll find yourself refreshed, happy, and able to focus better.
Get lunch outside the office, somewhere 10 minutes away. By the time youâ€™ve walked there and back, you've got half your walk time for the day. ðŸ˜ŽTRY THIS TODAY AND LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKED.

I know you laughed hard when you saw this, most developers hardly sleep and they believe its a norm, no dear it isn't, you are not mortal. Sleep is especially important if you're still in your teens, twenties and thirties. pulling an all-nighter is something that won't kill you, but will screw up your health if you're not careful. The older you become, the longer it takes to recuperate from sleepless nights. Burning the midnight oil may be necessary on occasions, but respect your health by not making it into a habit. Studies have shown that getting enough sleep significantly boosts your focus during the day, improves your immune system, and even enhances your memory.

### BALANCE
Let's use my personal life as an example, aside from being a front end developer I run a 9-5 as a health worker, I have a personal business I'm growing and I have to attend to people on all social media platform, I also do modelling jobs as a sideline.Having to do all these and still trying to balance my work life and personal life gets so overwhelming, sometimes I cry, breakdown and get discouraged. But what do I do... I take some time off to decompress and relax. Making a clear distinction between work and life can really help recharge your batteries. You'll be able to spend time with your family without being distracted by work. Put aside your phone and don't check email when spending time with friends and family. It truly helps recover from the day and prepare for the next

The fact that you are not moving, exercising or eating as well as others, further contribute towards having a strict diet plan. For those who are active, having a larger intake of food can be possible without gaining weight.

Food items like egg yolk, certain mushrooms, cheese, Soy products and other such items have a high concentration of Vitamin. These products may even help with the flow of blood to the brain and supplies the brain cells with more oxygen. Since these products are also anti-inflammatory, they help the brain function optimally.


- FRUITS AND VEGGIES-
