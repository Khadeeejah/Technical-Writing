## My  Chisquad Journey ü§ë

I recently became an Ambassadoor for [Chimoney](https://www.chimoney.io/), a payment infrastructure for startups, businesses, and developers. I was happy  when I received the mail because I adore the company and what they are building. I am sure you are interested in what they are building and what they do; my job as an ambassador is to keep you informed and to teach developers how to use their APIs in your project

# What Is Chimoney

Chimoney is a straightforward payment infrastructure that possesses superpowers. Chimoney is constructing ambitious APIs and infrastructure to allow the transfer of "value" between various asset kinds and ledgers on a global scale. Additionally, by requiring simply the recipients' email address or Twitter username, we  make it easier for organizations and initiatives to provide value to everyone in the world up to 1,000 recipients. Therefore, chimoney is for you if you are a developer, business owner, little or large scale, or you want to be able to send money to your loved ones around the world.

## Our Products.

Currently Chimoney has four products which are:

- Chipay

- Chispend


- Chiconnect

- Metaward


### [Chipay](https://www.chimoney.io/chipay)

Here is why this is my favorite product. Chipay is a platform for giving gifts to communities, campaigns, and contributors. For example, if you are hosting a contest, an event, etc. on a global scale by sending out airtime, data, and promotional items using only your Twitter handle or email. Yes, it is truly that simple.

I do not want you to miss out on the benefits that this platform has provided for thousands of users.
Avoid missing out on this chance by [signing up](https://dash.chimoney.io/auth/signin?next=/). We do sporadic giveaways on Twitter.

### Chispend

Gift Cards, Airtime, and other items can be purchased on the Chispend platform using tokens and NFTs stored in your wallet, app, or protocol. You may use any token, including meme tokens, using Chispend to buy real-world goods and services. Spend in-game awards, metaverse rewards, and reward tokens. It is advantageous to developers as well because you can turn your software into a Super App by offering prizes, services, and items to your customers. Make your game or wallet into an e-commerce app or a virtual community. The documentation is available  [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1163691/Tz5qacnt#intro).


### [Chiconnect](https://www.chimoney.io/chiconnect)

The tool for developers is called Chiconnect, and it allows developers to interact with Chimoney's payment API to move your money more quickly and in more ways than ever. Expect additional articles and lessons on this topic that will explain how to utilize the api and what to construct.

### Metaward

Get and send payments on and off the Metaverse with Metaward. Create a payment request and withdraw funds to crypto, airtime, mobile money, gift cards, and banks in different countries and metaverses. It has not yet been released, but trust me to keep you updated when it is. You can also learn more about it by clicking here.
