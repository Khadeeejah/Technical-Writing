In order to make your contributions count and be eligible for the rewards, please follow the instructions below carefully.

## Step 1

Navigate to Chimoney  [repository](https://github.com/Chimoney/chimoney-community-projects) on Github and fork it,

 ###  Step 2

Once this is done, navigate to the [ issues](https://github.com/Chimoney/chimoney-community-projects/issues) on the repo, and pick any of the issues  that has the **HACKTOBERFEST ** label only.

You can either leave a comment to indicate interest so that others know you are already working on it or just start working on it; I enjoy this aspect of contributing to open source projects because it keeps everyone on their toes, especially now that money is involved; I'm sure you don't want someone else to raise a PR before you.


 ###  Step 3 

You will primarily interact with two of our products. ChiSpend, unlocking utility by crypto tokens and NFTs to be spent, seamlessly integrate your platform tokens and create your spending experience

and ChiConnect, which is a powerful API that allows you to move non-diminishing rewards between banks, giftcards, airtime, momo, and so on.

To get started You will need **keys** to interface with our products. To do so, follow these simple steps below:


- Create an organization on [Chimoney dashboard](https://dash.chimoney.io/)

![Screen Shot 2022-10-04 at 5.27.06 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664890046550/Uh7kr-z8U.png align="left")


- Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/C74aUbpx) channel and send us the name of the organization. We will approve it!

- Switch to the organization (top right) and go to dev page. You'll see your keys. Itâ€™s live keys, for now. No test keys yet.


- We will add $10 for testing. You can always send $1 to yourself to test and redeem it back to the organization. That way, you will always have funds.


#### Step 4 

- Make sure you are familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- Head over to your forked repo and navigate to the code tab

  ![Screen Shot 2022-10-04 at 5.02.19 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664888588695/NA4B682lF.png align="left")

  Click on it and copy the ssh link. 

- Then head over to your terminal on vs or your command and type

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Khadeeejah/chimoney-community-projects.git
  ``` 

  This will clone the entire repo into your local machine. Thereafter, open the project on your Ide and create a new branch from main ( this is very important).

#### Step 5

Make your fix or additions and follow [conventional commit standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), push to your forked repo and  submit your pull request, wait for one of our maintainers to review and merge your PR .
